Obesity Dataset Classification and Analysis
This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis and classification workflow on the Obesity Dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and classification modeling to uncover insights and predict obesity-related outcomes. The steps are implemented using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Features of the Notebook
1. Data Exploration
Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded using pandas and preliminary inspections such as head(), tail(), shape, and info() are conducted.
Summary Statistics: Descriptive statistics (describe()) and data type inspection (dtypes) are provided.
Null Value Analysis: Identifies missing data and provides a count of null values in the dataset.
2. Visualizations
Gender Distribution: A countplot is used to visualize the distribution of genders in the dataset.
Age Distribution: A histogram (histplot) is plotted to explore the distribution of ages with a kernel density estimate (KDE).
3. Classification Model
The notebook aims to classify obesity-related outcomes based on various features. While the classification model implementation details aren't visible in the initial summary, the notebook likely includes:

Data preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling).
Model training and evaluation using machine learning techniques.
Dependencies
The notebook utilizes the following Python libraries:

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib
Statistical Analysis: scipy
Machine Learning: (presumably scikit-learn or similar)
